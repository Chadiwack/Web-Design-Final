<h1>About US</h1>
	<p class="center">The DPA has worked tirelessly with local and foreign governments to document, catalog, and on occasion destroy objects and entities that the world has yet to acknowledge as being “within the realm of possibility” Our scientists as well as our countless field agents work together to painstakingly find these entities and attempt to capture or placate them by any means necessary. </p>
