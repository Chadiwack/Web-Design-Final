	<h1 style="text-align: center">Our goals</h1><p>Established in 1943 following the "Dakota incident", The DPA is a functional off-shoot of the US Forest Service. At the Department of Paranormal Affairs our goal is the preservation, tracking, cataloging, and on very rare occasions the destruction of all the things that don't quite fit into the purview of what most might consider normal. We hope to educate the public on all these unruly things that go bump in the night so that we might avoid future cataclysmic paranormal events. While public safety has always been our main goal, we also hope to glean insight and benefit mankind at large.</p>

	<p>Following the "Dakota incident" our current head of DPA, Dr.Brenner set out to learn all he could about the paranorma. Losing his parents in the event worked as an insighting incident to sparking his insatiable hunger for knowledge of the occult and the unknown. Thanks to life extention efforts from DPA researchers and occultist practicioners, Dr.Brenner has remained our leader for the past 67 years, working tirelessly to bring the dark to the light.</p>
